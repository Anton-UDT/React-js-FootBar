# React-js-FootBar
This is a way of creating navigation from either a next page, a previous page or you can choose to go both
  
As a user    

I want to see a set of 3 images (bucket man, two figures and llama) when I move from the landing page and into the app.   

So that I am able to see what images are available and tap to select an image that I want to explore further.
